Creating and using FTP Client
### Description
This sample sets up a FTP server listening on port 12345 with a user account
serving the contents of the ram file system. Then it creates an FTP client,
connects to the server and uploads a file.  The script can be run using the emulator. If everything works, the script reports
that the file has been successfully written
